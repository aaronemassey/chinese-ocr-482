# Generate images

`makeimages.sh` generates images with ImageMagick from the text in REPOROOT/text

Ensure you have the font specified.  If you don't, replace the argument after `-font` with a font that has Chinese characters that you do have.  You can check which fonts you have installed with `convert -list font`.
